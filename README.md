# First-Steps
- Gotta begin somewhere, right? Keeping this open so anyone can see me slowly stumble along and possibly give me advice. Currently working on other goals so expect this to be done slowly untill I reach those goals.

- This repository will hold any code I write while I stumble around trying to learn C#. It wont be pretty at times but I think I can be excused considering Im starting fresh.
- I will update this readme as a sort of journal as I write new code and crawl along learning.
